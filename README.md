# HackUTD 2023: Statefarm ChatBot
Our project is submitted under the State Farm sponsored challenge.

Our idea is to create a chatbot integrated with many features suitable for small business owners. As a middleman between the client and a human employee, the chatbot serves to save time by 
-  fulfilling small tasks for current customers
-  guiding new customers
-  incorporating new tasks not found with typical B2C interaction.
